<h1>Emnist Dataset</h1>
<p>
The EMNIST (Extended MNIST) dataset is a collection of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19. It has been converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the original MNIST dataset, making it easily compatible with tools and models designed for MNIST.
