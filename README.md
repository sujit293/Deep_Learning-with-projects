<h1>Emnist Dataset</h1>
<p>
The EMNIST (Extended MNIST) dataset is a collection of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19. It has been converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the original MNIST dataset, making it easily compatible with tools and models designed for MNIST.

  <p>A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful type of neural network particularly well-suited for image recognition tasks, and it's often used with the EMNIST dataset for handwritten character and digit recognition. CNNs excel at this task due to their ability to learn and extract hierarchical features from images, such as edges and shapes, which are crucial for recognizing handwritten characters. </p>
